# Authentication - Getting started

A local YDB database deployed with one of the self-hosted 'Getting started' scenarios does not require authentication, that is, runs in [anonymous mode](../../concepts/connect.md#auth-modes).

Full information about all available authentication methods is given in the [DB connection](../../concepts/connect.md) article under "Concepts".

## Next step {#next}

Go to [YDB CLI: Getting started](../cli.md) to proceed with the 'Getting started' scenario.
